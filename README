piplineViewer is PERT task viewer developed by Walt Disney Animation Studios for
displaying shotgun tasks in a PERT graph view.

The pipelineViewer.py a Shotgun Action Menu item.  It is being deployed on an Apache
server with mod_python installed.

pipelineViewer is built in python and uses pydot to product the PERT graphic image.  pydot
is a python API over graphviz, so you will need graphviz as well as pyparsing python modules.
You can find pydot at http://code.google.com/p/pydot/

To create the menu item, the normal Shotgun API can be used to create the action item.
For instance:
sg = shotgun(.....)
data = {
        "title": "Pipeline View", 
        "url": "<serverpathtopipelineviewer>/pipelineViewer/view", 
        "list_order": 1,
        "entity_type": "Task",
        'selection_required': False
        }
sg.create( "ActionMenuItem", data )

You will need to provide your shotgun server, script and key parameters.   We also use python 
logging services, you might need to adjust accordingly
